This is kind of question that is often asked as basic in interviews

Qualitative is name, string, text, age group, various sports, we can’t apply aggregate function on them, we can only see their frequency.

Quantitative is basically numbers

Primary Data is basically source

Secondary data is collected by someone else, or research, once reasearch is done then you upload it there like Kaggle, DataWorld etc.
